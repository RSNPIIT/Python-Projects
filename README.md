# Python-Projects

A collection of my personal Python mini-projects and experiments.

## ðŸ“‚ Current Projects

### Python
- **cafeman.py**  
  A simple CafÃ© Management CLI mini-project written in Python.  
- **rent.py**  
  Rent calculator for hostel/flat rooms.  

### R

  Simple arithmetic operations in R (sum, product, difference, division, remainder).  
  *A little easter egg highlighting R as a super underrated language.*

- Python 3.x  
- R

### ðŸ¥š Easter Egg

Besides Python projects, this repo includes a small R script (`math_ops.R`)  
just for funâ€”a little easter egg showing R as a super underrated language.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
Clone the repository and run any project directly:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:RSNPIIT/Python-Projects.git
cd Python-Projects
python3 cafeman.py
python3 rent.py
# or for R projects
Rscript math_ops.R a b
where a is the first number and b is the second number 

It uses the CPython compiler and the RLang Compiler
