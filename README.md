🐍 Python-Projects

A growing collection of small Python mini-projects (plus the occasional R script) built while exploring different ideas, tools, and programming concepts.

📂 Project Overview

This repository serves as a sandbox for experiments, practice exercises, and mini-utilities. Each script is stand-alone—you can clone the repo and run any file directly.

Typical themes include:

- Command-line utilities and calculators
- Small games and interactive scripts
- Fun/random generators
- Quick data-processing snippets
- Occasional R experiments

New scripts may appear at any time as I learn or prototype new ideas.

🛠 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x (standard library only unless noted in the script header)
- Optional: R for the few `.R` files
- Some Python scripts may use **Cython** to improve speed

All projects are implemented using **FOSS tools only**:

- Python, R  
- Linux (Kali, Fedora, Ubuntu, etc.)  
- Terminals: Yakuake, Konsole  
- Editors: VSCodium  

🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository and run any script of your choice:

### Python scripts
```bash
python3 project_name.py
# example:
python3 passwordgen.py

R scripts

Rscript project_name.R
# example:
Rscript math_ops.R
