A growing collection of small Python mini-projects built while exploring different ideas, tools, and programming concepts.

📂 Project Overview

This repository serves as a sandbox for experiments, practice exercises, and mini-utilities. Each script is stand-alone—you can clone the repo and run any file directly.

Typical themes include:

- Command-line utilities and calculators
- Small games and interactive scripts
- Fun/random generators
- Quick data-processing snippets

New scripts may appear at any time as I learn or prototype new ideas.

🛠 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x (standard library only unless noted in the script header)
- Some Python scripts may use **Cython** to improve speed

All projects are implemented using **FOSS tools only**:

- Python  
- Linux (Kali, Fedora, Ubuntu, etc.)  
- Terminals: Yakuake, Konsole  
- Editors: VSCodium  

🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository and run any script of your choice:

### Python scripts
```bash
python3 project_name.py
# example:
python3 passwordgen.py

📝 Notes

These projects are mainly built in Python, but they are designed to be language-agnostic — the logic, flow, and problem-solving approach can be explored and implemented in any language you love. Code is universal; syntax is just an accent.

The projects are under the GPL-3 License, which permits anybody to use, modify, and tinker with the code freely, provided that any derivative work is also shared under an open-source license.

All projects have been done from a student-friendly point of view, allowing easy understanding.

Please take your time to review the code and contribute to the same, as all my code was, is, and will remain open for collaboration.
