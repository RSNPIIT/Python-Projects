🐍 Python-Projects

A growing collection of small Python mini-projects (plus the occasional R script) built while exploring different ideas, tools, and programming concepts.

📂 Project Overview

This repository serves as a sandbox for experiments, practice exercises, and mini-utilities.
Each script is stand-alone—you can clone the repo and run any file directly.

Typical themes include:

Command-line utilities and calculators

Small games and interactive scripts

Fun/random generators

Quick data-processing snippets

Occasional R experiments

New scripts may appear at any time as I learn or prototype new ideas.

🛠 Tech Stack

Python 3.x (standard library only unless noted in the script header)

Optional: R for the few .R files
