# 🐍 Python-Projects

A growing collection of small **Python** mini-projects (plus a tiny R script for fun).

---

## 📂 Projects

### Python
- **cafeman.py**  
  Command-line café/restaurant manager: lets users place multiple orders, calculates totals, and applies a 10% discount on bills above ₹500.
- **rockpaperscissor.py**  
  Interactive Rock–Paper–Scissor game with case-insensitive input, multi-round play, score tracking, streak tracking, and an exit command. (`python3 rockpaperscissor.py`)
- **rent.py**  
  Simple rent calculator for hostel/flat rooms.
- **todoapp.py**  
  Menu-driven task manager to add, delete, and list tasks interactively.

### R
- **math_ops.R**  
  Performs basic arithmetic (sum, product, difference, division, remainder).  
  *A little Easter-egg salute to the underrated R language.*

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x** (CPython) — all scripts are plain Python, no external dependencies.
- **R** (Rscript) for the small R utility.
