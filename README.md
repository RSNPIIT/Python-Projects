### ðŸ¥š Easter Egg

Besides Python projects, this repo includes a small R script (`math_ops.R`)  
just for funâ€”a little easter egg showing R as a super underrated language.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:RSNPIIT/Python-Projects.git
cd Python-Projects
python3 cafeman.py
python3 rent.py
# or for R projects
Rscript math_ops.R 12 5
