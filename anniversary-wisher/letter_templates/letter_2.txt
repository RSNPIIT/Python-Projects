Hey [NAME],

Happy birthday! I hope today brings you plenty of smiles, good vibes, and a well-deserved break from the usual routine. Birthdays are a great excuse to pause, celebrate yourself, and enjoy the little things — especially good food and good company.

May the year ahead be filled with good health, new opportunities, and moments that make you genuinely happy. And yes, don’t forget to eat lots of cake — it’s practically a rule today.

Lots of love,
Ramrup
