Dear [NAME],

It’s your birthday — wishing you a truly wonderful day!

I hope today brings you happiness, good company, and a few moments to relax and enjoy yourself. Birthdays are a nice reminder to slow down for a bit, appreciate how far you’ve come, and look forward to what’s ahead.

May the year ahead be filled with good health, positive moments, and things that make you smile.

All my love,
Ramrup
