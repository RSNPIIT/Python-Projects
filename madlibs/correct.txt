One day, a X engineering student named A decided to build a X Kettle.

Everyone in Office said it was X, but A didn’t care. Armed with a C and an unreasonable amount of Cry, the project began.

On the third day, something went terribly wrong. The Kettle started to D uncontrollably, making a sound like Y.

Instead of panicking, A shouted,

"This is exactly as I calculated!"

With one bold move involving a Z, everything suddenly became X.

By sunset, the once X idea had turned into the most X invention in all of Office.

And that is how a simple B changed everything.
