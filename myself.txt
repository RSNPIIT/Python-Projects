My name is Ramrup Satpati, and I am an undergraduate student at IIT Madras with a strong curiosity for technology and problem-solving. I enjoy learning across disciplines and working on ideas that combine engineering, data, design, and thoughtful execution to create real-world impact.

Alongside my academics, I currently serve as a Campus Partner (2025) at Perplexity, representing IIT Madras as part of a global initiative focused on improving access to knowledge and encouraging innovation.

Over time, I have completed 70+ certifications from organizations such as Microsoft, NVIDIA, Dell, HP, UNICEF, and the United Nations. These reflect both my technical learning and my interest in social awareness. I actively learn through platforms such as NPTEL, GeeksforGeeks, Forage, HP Life, Simplilearn, Tutedude, and Intellipaat. I believe in exploring multiple fields with depth rather than limiting myself to a single domain.
