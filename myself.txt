About Me

I kindly invite you to connect with me on LinkedIn:
https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramrup-satpati-683970341/

My name is Ramrup Satpati, and I am an undergraduate student at IIT Madras with a strong interest in technology, interdisciplinary learning, and building solutions that create meaningful impact. I enjoy exploring ideas at the intersection of engineering, analytics, design, and leadership.

Alongside my academic journey, I currently serve as a Campus Partner (2025) at Perplexity, representing IIT Madras as part of a global initiative focused on innovation and knowledge accessibility.

Over time, I have earned 70+ certifications from organizations such as Microsoft, NVIDIA, Dell, HP, UNICEF, and the United Nations, reflecting both technical learning and social awareness. My learning journey spans multiple platforms including NPTEL, GeeksforGeeks, Forage, HP Life, Simplilearn, Tutedude, Intellipaat, and others. I believe in exploring multiple domains deeply rather than restricting myself to a single discipline.
