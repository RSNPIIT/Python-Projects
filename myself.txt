💡 About Myself :-> :

I'm Ramrup Satpati, an undergraduate student at IIT Madras with a deep passion for tech-driven innovation, interdisciplinary learning, and creating meaningful impact through code, design, and leadership. Currently, I also serve as a 2025 Campus Partner at Perplexity, representing IIT Madras in this global initiative.

With 70+ certifications to my name from global leaders like Microsoft, NVIDIA, Dell, HP, and impact-driven institutions like UNICEF and the United Nations, I’ve built a diverse portfolio that reflects both technical depth and social awareness. My learning journey includes platforms like Tutedude, Simplilearn, HP Life, Intellipaat, NPTEL, Forage, and GeeksforGeeks, because I believe in diversifying across branches rather than limiting myself to one field.

🔧 What I bring to the table:

Strong foundation in Python, SQL, AI/ML, Data Science, and Data Structures & Algorithms

Experience building full-stack web applications using Flask, MERN stack, and SQLite

Curiosity and practical understanding of cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and UI/UX design

Excellent communication skills by virtue of being a polyglot (fluent in Bengali, Hindi, Odia, Assamese, English, and Sanskrit)

Interest and exposure in Financial Modeling, Risk Management, and Stock Market Analytics

👨‍💻 Industry Experience

Backend Intern at Solidron Pvt. Ltd., contributing to scalable backend systems

Head Member (Bihar–Jharkhand Region), leading outreach and coordination efforts with impact

Lead Crew Member and Lead Discord Manager at Aspire Institute DLP Leadership Program, building and leading with purpose

Campus Partner at Perplexity (2025), IIT Madras representative in a global leadership initiative

Member of Saranda House, IITM BS, actively participating in academic and cultural life with experience in several hackathons, designathons, and ideathons

Professional Objective:
"To leverage my technical expertise, problem-solving ability, and passion for innovation to build impactful solutions in software development and data-driven technologies. I aim to contribute to projects that combine creativity and technology, while continuously learning and growing into a role where I can make a meaningful difference for both the organization and society."

🌱 I’m constantly evolving — blending engineering, analytics, and creativity to build solutions that matter. Whether in tech, finance, or leadership, I strive to leave every space better than I found it.

Let’s connect — I’m always up for knowledge-sharing, collaboration, or just a great conversation!
